# 📧 AI Email Automation  

🚀 **Goal:** Automate repetitive email tasks using AI — summarization, categorization, and forwarding to the right system.  

---

## 📝 Problem  
Business owners and bookkeepers waste time:  
- Reading long client emails  
- Manually forwarding messages to the right team  
- Copy-pasting details into tools (QuickBooks, Trello, or Google Sheets)  

---

## 🤖 No-Code Solution  
Using **Zapier / n8n**:  
1. **Trigger** → When a new email arrives in Gmail/Outlook  
2. **AI Step** → Summarize and categorize the email (Invoice, Query, Update, etc.)  
3. **Filter** → If it’s an invoice → forward to Bookkeeping folder/QuickBooks  
4. **Action** → Log summary into Google Sheets for recordkeeping
